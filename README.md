  # Creating a Team Page Using Classes 
  ## Description
  This application allows a team manager to quickly and easily compile basic information of team members onto an html page. It collects unique information for interns, engineers, and managers and displays it on cards, including contact information, id numbers, github profiles, office numbers, school, etc.

  ## Installation
  Use `npm i` to install the dependencies. This app uses NPM Inquirer for prompt questions and NPM Jest for testing.
  ## Usage
  To run this CLI application, type `node app.js` into the terminal. After answering all the prompts for each team member and ending with the "No, I'm done." option, the team.html file that displays your team's information will be created in the "output" folder. Open in any browser or add the file to a website.

  ## Future Functionality
  This application would be most useful if a manager were able to append new team members instead of overwriting every time. This would require another question prompt and `fs.appendfile` rather than `fs.writefile`.
